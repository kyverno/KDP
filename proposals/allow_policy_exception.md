## Introduction

Kyverno policy rules contain an `exclude` block which allows excluding admission requests by resource (name, API group, versions, and kinds), resource labels, namespaces, namespace labels, users, use groups, service accounts, user role and groups. This construct allows flexibility in selecting when a policy should be applied to a admission review request.

This proposal introduces the concept of a `PolicyException` which is similar to the `exclude` declaration but is decoupled from the policy lifecycle.

## The Problem

Policies are often managed via GitOps, and a global policy set may apply across several clusters. In some cases a policy override may be required in specific clusters. Hence, managing exceptions in the policy declaration itself can become painful.

In addition, when a policy exception declaration is updated, there is no clear record of why that exception was added.

These pain points are well ariculated in the following GitHub issue and discussion:

- [Overwriting Existing policies](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/discussions/4310)
- [Feature: New CRDs for PolicyViolationExcepotions](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/issues/2627)

## Proposed Solution

Considering different organizations may have different requirement on the `request-response` workflow, we decided to allow admins to manage the approval process using existing tools, such as GitOps, RBAC, or signing.

For the first version, We would mainly focus on how Kyverno would deal with those exceptions.

A new CRD `PolicyException` would be introduced:

- **PolicyException**: a CR to tell Kyverno which policies / rules to bypass

This CR should only be created after the request is approved.
The scope can either be namespaced / cluster-wide.

`PolicyException` sample:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v2alpha1
kind: PolicyException
metadata:
  name: bypass-test-deployment
  namespace: kyverno
spec:
  exceptions:
    - policyName: require-labels
      ruleNames:
        - check-for-labels
        - autogen-check-for-labels
  match:
    any:
      - resources:
          kinds:
            - Deployment
          names:
            - nginx
          namespaces:
            - default
      - resources:
          kinds:
            - Pod
          namespaces:
            - default
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: nginx
```

Corresponding ClusterPolicy:

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: require-labels
spec:
  validationFailureAction: Enforce
  rules:
    - name: check-for-labels
      match:
        any:
          - resources:
              kinds:
                - Pod
      validate:
        message: "label 'app.kubernetes.io/name' is required"
        pattern:
          metadata:
            labels:
              app.kubernetes.io/name: "?*"
```

**Notice**: We recommend users to specify one policy in each exception manifest. This would avoid potential logic error.

Due to the autogen machanism of kyverno, users may need to specify additional rules (such as `autogen-check-for-labels`). The admission webhook denial log can be referred.

## Implementation Notes

We will introduce a new CRD: `PolicyException`.

Kyverno would check if there is a matching `PolicyException` when validate / mutate / generate / imageVerify for each rule.

If there is a matching exception, the rule status would be set as `skip` when building the rule response.

If there is no matching exception, the rule response would be nil.

If there is an error, the rule status would be set as `error` and report.

## Alternative Solution

To introduce two new Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that enable managing policy exceptions:

- **PolicyExceptionRequest**: a request to exclude a resource from a policy rule, namespaced / cluster-wide
- **PolicyExceptionResponse**: a cluster-wide resource that response to a specific `PolicyExceptionRequest`

#### High-Level Flow

There are 2 personnas that would be involved:

- **Policy User**: able to create, delete , and modify `PolicyExceptionRequest` resources
- **Policy Admin**: able to review `PolicyExceptionRequest`; and create, delete, modify `PolicyExceptionResponse` resources

1. A user that is impacted by a policy violation can create a `PolicyExceptionRequest` for their workload:
   `PolicyExceptionRequest` sample:

```yaml
spec:
  exceptions:
    - policyName: "pod-security"
      ruleNames:
        - "restricted"
      reason: "..."
      exclude: {} # same as a policy exclude declaration
      duration: "30d" # optional time string
status:
  state: "Pending" # Pending | Approved | Denied
```

`spec` is where the user fills in the request.

- exceptions: a list of exception objects:
  - policyName: target policy name (string)
  - ruleNames: an array of target rule names (string)
  - reason: brief explanation for the exception
  - exclude: specify the resource that need to be excluded from the target policy, it can be [MatchResources](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/blob/v1.8.0-rc2/api/kyverno/v1/match_resources_types.go#L10)
  - duration(optional): how long the exception would be valid

`status` is where the `PolicyExceptionController` would automatically update based on Policy Admin activity and other updates.

**PolicyExceptionRequest lifecycle**

- If the `state` is `Pending` (the default), user can delete or modify the PolicyExceptionRequest.
- If the state is `Approved`, user will be blocked from modifying the PolicyExceptionRequest.
- The user can always delete the PolicyExceptionRequest when it is no longer required.
- If the state is `Denied`, user can modify the request. The controller would change the state back to `Pending`. We can use RBAC to restrict such accessibility.

2. The admin can review the `PolicyExceptionRequest` and can either `approve` or `deny` it. This is done by creating a corresponding `PolicyExceptionResponse` which serves as a log of approval (or denial) decisions.

`PolicyExceptionResponse` sample:

```yaml
spec:
  approvalPolicy: Manual # Manual (default) | Automatic
  name: permit-root-user
  status: "Approved" # Approved | Denied
  reason: "..."
```

- approvalPolicy: policies that are approved manually / automatically
- name: name of corresponding `PolicyExceptionRequest`, should be unique
- status: whether admin decide to approve / deny the `PolicyExceptionRequest`
- reason: why admin approve / deny the `PolicyExceptionRequest`

The `status` and `reason` would also be updated to the `PolicyExceptionRequest` to let the user know by the `PolicyExceptionController`.

#### Ideal Usage

1. User creates a CR `PolicyExceptionRequest` to request for exception.
2. Admin reviews the request, and create a corresponding `PolicyExceptionResponse` to approve / deny the request.
3. A new `PolicyExceptionController` would update the `PolicyExceptionRequest` based on admin's feedback. If not approved, user can modify and resubmit `PolicyExceptionRequest`.
4. All of the `PolicyExceptionResponse` would be cached by Kyverno for policy match and exclude.
5. User creates the corresponding resource.
   Kyverno matches the resource with corresponding policies and exceptions. If all broken rules can be matched with exceptions, let the request pass.
   There would be logs in PolicyReport indicating which exceptions the resource has passed.

#### Possible User Stories

**As a user, I want an exception from the latest tag rule for test.**

**a. What policy blocks what resources/user?**

The policy blocks users from deploying an image tag called `latest`.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: disallow-latest-tag
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  background: true
  rules:
    - name: validate-image-tag
      match:
        resources:
          kinds:
            - Deployment
      validate:
        message: "Using a mutable image tag e.g. 'latest' is not allowed."
        pattern:
          spec:
            template:
              spec:
                containers:
                  - image: "!*:latest"
```

**b. What scenario the user want to exclude from the policy?**

The user may not have access to create a new tag. The default one would be 'latest'. Then this would violate the policy.

**c. Why it is not necessary to modify the policy?**

The original rule is still valid for the other workloads. We just need an exception for the dev test.

**d. How does the user write the new CR?**

The user needs to specify the target policy / rule, and to what kind of resource the exception would take effect.

```yaml
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: PolicyExceptionRequest
metadata:
  name: allow-tag-for-test
spec:
  exceptions:
    - policyName: disallow-latest-tag
      ruleNames:
        - validate-image-tag
  reason: allow-latest-tag-for-test
  exclude:
    all:
      - name: test
        kind:
          - Deployment
        namespace:
          - dev
```

The `state` would be automatically changed to `Pending`.

**e. How does the administrator review the CR?**

Once the CR is created, the admin can review the CR and create a corresponding `PolicyExceptionResponse`.

(1) The admin reject the request by creating a `PolicyExceptionResponse`, setting the `status` as `Denied`.

```yaml
spec:
  approvalPolicy: manual
  name: allow-tag-for-test
  status: Denied
  reason: ...
```

(2) The admin approve the request by creating a `PolicyExceptionResponse`, setting the `status` as `Approved`.

```yaml
spec:
  approvalPolicy: manual
  name: allow-tag-for-test
  status: Approved
  reason: ...
```

**f. What happened if the CR get rejected?**

The `status` in the `PolicyExceptionRequest` would be updated to `Denied`, and the `reason` in the `PolicyExceptionRequest` would also be updated to tell the user the rejection reason.

The user can modify `PolicyExceptionRequest` based on feedback and resubmit. The `status` in `PolicyExceptionRequest` would be then changed to `Pending` again and wait to be reviewed.

**g. What happened next if the CR get approved?**

Now the `PolicyExceptionRequest` is valid. Kyverno would cache the approved `PolicyExceptionResponse`, and use in the logic for policy match and exclude.

**h. What does the user need to do after?**

Once the `PolicyExceptionRequest` gets approved, it automatically take effect. The user can now create the resource.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: test
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: test
spec:
  containers:
    - name: test
      image: test:latest
```

**i. What if the user try to violate another policy rule that is not included by the exception request?**

If the breaking rule cannot be matched with the exceptions, the requested resources should be blocked still.

### Alternative Implementation Notes

We will introduce a new controller: `PolicyExceptionController` and two new CRDs: `PolicyExceptionRequest` and `PolicyExceptionResponse`.

We can use `Kubebuilder` to scaffold the new operator. The CRDs `PolicyExceptionRequest` and `PolicyExceptionResponse` are also defined in this scaffold project.

The `PolicyExceptionController` would act as a bridge between `PolicyExceptionRequest` and `PolicyExceptionResponse`.

More specifically, the controller will:

- Watch the `PolicyExceptionResponse`, updates `status` & `reason` for corresponding `PolicyExceptionRequest`
- Prevent user from modifying `PolicyExceptionRequest` when admin is creating the `PolicyExceptionResponse` with resource version ID
- Block changes to `PolicyExceptionRequest` if the `state` is `Approved`
- Change `state` back to `Pending` if user modified `PolicyExceptionRequest`
- Clean up stale / invalid `PolicyExceptionResponse`
- Handle auto Approvals in the future
- Handle signed Approvals in the future

We will design the admission webhooks to mutate & validate the `PolicyExceptionResponse` when it is created / updated.

- If the `status` is `Approved`, it would add `exclude` spec to `PolicyExceptionResponse`, along with the approvalTime in the `mutating` period.
- If the `status` is `Pending` or `Denied`, it the request won't pass the `validating`.

Kyverno would cache those approved `PolicyExceptionResponse` with `exclude` spec. We may introduce a new `ExceptionInformer` to get these CRs in the cluster.

When the user applies the target resource, Kyverno would go through the policy check. A new method will be introduced to fetch excpetions and add them to the policy rule `exclude` block.

### Questions and Notes

1. The PolicyExceptionRequest is namespaced. Is there a use-case for a cluster-wide exception?

- Both namespaced & cluster-wide need to be taken into consideration.

2. Each new CR has a independent lifecycle and is managed by different roles. This seems OK, but needs more analysis.

3. The PolicyExceptionController will manage the `status` of the PolicyExceptionRequest and also watch the PolicyExceptionApprovals. Is this an appropriate controller design?

## Next Steps

This proposal just provides a solution for basic exception. There are many other things need to be taken into consideration.

1. More user stories / functions
2. Request-Response machanism
3. Exceptions lifecycle management
4. Auto-approvals
5. Exception cleanup
6. Documentation
